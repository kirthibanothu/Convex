## Documentation
Documentation can be generated by running

```bash
$ cd docs/
$ make html
```

## Tests

Tests can be ran by running `py.test` in the top level module.

## Running The Application
    We have a micro service basic architecture with GUI pieces.
    The Dashboard is the main GUI right now.
        - To launch the dashboard:
            - ./services/dashboard.py
        - To launch the services that it needs:
            - ./services/depth_feed.py
            - ./services/click_trader.py <API_KEY> <API_SECRET> <PASSPHRASE> 0.0.0.0 8003
        - Most apps are self explanatory - check config section
    Using Autodev
        - ./autodev.sh /path/to/repo/ API_KEY API_SECRET PASSPHRASE IN_DEV INSTRUMENT

Limitations:
    - Most of the configuration for the GUI's are hard coded as of right now. Need to make this configurable in some intelligible way.
