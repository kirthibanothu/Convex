    Price Improvement:
        Orders are matched against existing order book orders at the price of
        the order on the book, not at the price of the taker order.

    Orders can be partially filled.

Fees:
    Maker: 0%
    Taker: 0.25%

    There is an existing SELL order for 5 BTC at 100 USD on the order book.
    You enter a BUY order for 7 BTC at 100 USD.
    5 BTC of your BUY order are immediately matched and you are charged the
    taker fee because you are taking liquidity from the order book.
    The remaining 2 BTC of your order are now sitting on the BID side of the
    order book. A SELL order for 2 BTC at 100 USD arrives and matches against
    your 2 BTC BUY order.
    In this case you provided liquidity and are not charged any fees.
